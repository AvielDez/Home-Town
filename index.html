                        <h3>Sonoran <span>Desert</span></h3>
                        <p>When you think about a desert, you might think of a hot, dry, dusty place.
                            That’s not the Sonoran Desert. It has tree-covered mountains, grassy plains, and hot valleys. 
                            It even has rivers, but many of them don’t have water all the time.
                        </p>

                        <p>The Sonoran region is a hot desert! If you are willing to stick around you can witness the spectacular monsoon storms scattered throughout the Tucson area. 
                            Be beneath the storm or appreciate them from a distance with plenty of high areas for the best views.

                        <p>Famous for the Saguaro Cactus, Tucson and the surrounding area is full of  unique plant and animal life. From scarce desert valleys filled with mammals and dangerous reptiles 
                            to canyons and mountains filled tall forrest trees, mountain lions and bears.

                            This Museum is a must see! Even the drive to get there just after a monsoon rain is a wonderful
                            experience all on its own.

                        <p>Visitors to this biodiverse Sky Island are delighted by the hiking, skiing and rock climbing — just an hour from Tucson, Arizona.
                            Mount Lemmon offers an escape from the city for metropolitan Tucsonans.

                            about 10 miles south of downtown Tucson. The church was founded long before Arizona became a state. 
                            Over 200 years old! The thick walls provide a great escape from the heat.

                            atmosphere and good drink selections. I would personally recommend the 'Cast Iron Duck Confit'

                            You may have a short wait during peak dining hours, but it's well worth the wait. 
                            Service at Mi Nidito is as warm as a desert summer day.

                    <p>Is Tucson good for hiking?
                        YES! With five mountain ranges surrounding town and a national park, 
                        Tucson is a great place to put your boots on. I cannot recommend this enough. If you enjoy hiking, you'll love Tucson.

                    <p>This was one of my favorite pass times. At night, find a main road in Tucson called Campbell Ave. Follow this road
                        towards the northern mountains until you hit a loop. You'll be forced to turn around and be pleasantly surprised by the city lights.
